                    Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">there are the different: <br>
                    textContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting
                    purposes only. innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements.
                    innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.

                    Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">there are about the event delegation in dom: <br>
                    Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events. Events can be added to
                    a parent element instead of adding to every single element. It refers to the process of using event
                    propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the
                    event originated. <br>
                    Key points about event delegation: Efficiency, Event bubbling, Dynamic element support.

                    Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">about the event bubbling: <br>
                    Event bubbling directs an event to its target. It works like this, When an element
                    is clicked, an event is directed to the element. If an event handler is set for the element, the
                    event handler is triggered. Then the event "bubbles up" to the elements parent. <br>
                    Key points about event bubbling: Propagation path, Event handlers, Useful for event delegation.

                    Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove elements using JavaScript?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">Yes, to add elements at a specific index, use the splice method. The splice
                    method allows you to add and remove elements from a specific index in an array.</p>
